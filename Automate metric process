Master File Preparation:

The TechADS Controls Team opens the master Excel file.
The file contains monthly metrics and control failures for three domains: Change, Application, and RMO.


Failure Classification:

The Controls Team reviews and classifies each failure as included or excluded.
Any failure that should not be counted as a failure is marked as excluded.
Metric Calculation:

A Python script processes the master Excel file.
It calculates the final metric values, accounting for excluded failures.


PowerPoint Report Generation:

The script inputs the final metric values into a PARC Metrics PowerPoint template for each domain.


Data Upload to Governance Systems:

The script uploads the final metric values and the generated PowerPoint reports to the Governance SharePoint and Database.


Final Data Submission to ORCIT:

The script uploads the final metric values to ORCIT.
